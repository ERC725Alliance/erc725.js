# Providers

The provider by which erc725.js will request blockchain data is set on
the instantiation of the class, through the configuration object.

The following provider types are supported:

## Web3

This will use the web3 provider available at web3.providers

``` javascript
import Web3 from 'web3'

const web3provider = new Web3(new Web3.providers.HttpProvider('https://rpc.l14.lukso.network'));
```

## Ethereum (Metamask)

This is the provider available at `window.ethereum` injected into a
compatible web browser from the [Metamask plugin](https://metamask.io/).

``` javascript
const ethereumProvider = window.ethereum;
```

## Graphql (Apollo)

Also supported is a [GraphQL
client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/) as the provider.

``` javascript
import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache } from '@apollo/client';

const apolloProvider = new ApolloClient({
  uri: 'http://localhost:8080/graphql',
  cache: new InMemoryCache(),
  fetchOptions: {
    mode: 'no-cors'
  }
});

// NOTE: The apollo provider *must* be passed as a member of an object along
// with a type member when creating a new instance of the ERC725 class.
const providerParam = {
    provider: apolloProvider,
    type: 'ApolloClient'
}
```

:::note Note
Currently the `link` property of the options object for the Apollo client
is not supported, and known to not function correctly.
